            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <h3>Pirozhki Dough</h3>
                <li>Put the yeast in a large mixing bowl. Combine the water & milk & heat 
                    for about 45 seconds or so in the microwave to make it nice & warm. Pour 
                    this mixture over the yeast, sprinkle in a little sugar, & let sit for 
                    about 15 minutes to foam up. Add in the Tbsp. of oil, 2 tsp. sugar, salt, 
                    & flour. Mix on low with a dough hook until the dough comes together & is 
                    fully combined.</li>
                <li>Dip your hands in flour & scrape the dough from the sides of the bowl so it's 
                    somewhat ball-ish in the center of the bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap & 
                    let rise in a warm place for about an hour. (I turned my oven to "warm" for 
                    about a minute, then turned it off & closed the dough in there). Flour your hands 
                    again & scrape down the dough. Mix it on low speed again for about a minute 
                    & then cover it & rise it again in the same way for another hour. Prepare the 
                    filling during this time.</li>
                <h3>Tonkatsu part</h3>
                <li>In a heavy-bottomed pan, bring about 1" or so of canola oil to 350ºF. Rinse 
                    the pork & pat it dry with a paper towel. Score each piece a little with a 
                    sharp knife, & then sprinkle a little salt & pepper on both sides. Cut each 
                    cutlet in half along the length. Put the flour, beaten egg, & panko crumbs 
                    in seperate bowls. Dredge each piece of pork in flour, then dip in egg, & 
                    then coat well in panko.</li>
                <li>Depending on the size of your pan, place a few breaded pork pieces in the 
                    oil at a time, making sure not to crowd (so, 2-3 pieces should be fine). 
                    Cook until deep golden brown & crispy, turning to evenly cook both sides, 
                    about 4-5 mins total (make sure the temperature in stable!). Remove the 
                    tonkatsu to a paper towel-lined wire rack.</li>
                <h3>Katsudon part</h3>
                <li>In a small pan, combine 1/4 cup of the dashi stock, 1 Tbsp. of mirin, 
                    1/2 Tbsp. soy sauce, & 1/2 Tbsp. sugar with about 1/4 of the cut onions, 
                    & bring to a boil so that the onions get tender, stirring occasionally. 
                    Cut each tonkatsu piece into a few horizontal strips, keeping the strips 
                    of each piece together (you don't need to cut them completely through like 
                    with regular katsudon, but it's not a big deal if you do). Place 2 of the 
                    cut tonkatsu into the pan & break an egg over each. Cover the pan with a 
                    lid & let cook until the eggs are set. Remove to a large plate. Repeat 
                    these steps (combining the sauce ingredients w/ onions, cutting the tonkatsu, 
                    cooking with egg) until each tonkatsu has egg & onion. If there is any 
                    sauce/liquid from the pan throughout the process, reserve it in a little 
                    measuring cup.</li>
                <h3>Making the Pirozhki</h3>
                <li>Heat about 1 1/2" of oil in the heavy-bottomed pan to 350ºF (just add 
                    a little more oil to the pan you used earlier, after scooping out any 
                    panic crumbs). Heavily flour your hands & a flat work surface. Pull 
                    off about a palm-sized portion of dough & flatten it on the work 
                    surface, in the flour. Roll the dough to about 4 1/2" x 6" (doesn't 
                    need to be exact, but you want it flat, without being so thin that 
                    it tears).</li>
                <li>Place about a Tbsp. worth of cooked rice down the center, staying 
                    away from the edges. Place a bunch of frozen peas on the rice (or 
                    you could do peas first & then rice), then lay on an egg & onion 
                    covered katsu piece (you want the katsu to be about 1 1/2" wide x 
                    about 3" - 3 1/2" long. If the piece is too big, just trim it & 
                    use the extra pieces for another piroshki). Put more onions & egg 
                    on if needed & put about another Tbsp. of rice on top with some 
                    more peas. If you have any reserve sauce/liquid, pour a little bit 
                    on. Draw up the edges of the dough & pinch them to close. Carefully 
                    pick up the piroshki & roll it in your hands to smooth it out & 
                    shape it basically like a potato. Repeat this process until all 
                    of the katsu et al has been bundled up in piroshki dough.</li>
                <li>Lower a piroshki or two (depending on the size of your pan) 
                    into the hot oil & cook until a deep golden brown, turning to 
                    evenly cook both sides (keeping an eye on the oil temperature - you 
                    want it at 350ºF). Remove to a paper towel-lined rack & let cool 
                    until able to handle comfortably. Serve as is or with a little tonkatsu 
                    sauce on the side for dipping (mixed with a little spicy sauce if 
                    you prefer that!).</li>
